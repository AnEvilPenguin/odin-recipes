    <h2>Description</h2>
    <div class="description">
        <p>A good tomato sauce has countless uses.</p>
        <p>Make a big batch, then use in other dishes throughout the week.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>4 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>2 onions (finely chopped)</li>
        <li>2 carrots (finely chopped)</li>
        <li>2 celery sticks (finely chopped)</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves (crushed)</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>4 x 400g cans chopped tomatoes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a pan and add the vegetables and bay leaf.</li>
        <li>Stir in the sugar with some salt. Gently cook for 10-15 mins until the veg is tender.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tomatoes and 150ml water. Simmer very gently for 30 mins until the sauce has reduced by
            two-thirds and is very thick. If you have doubled or tripled the quantities, this may take up to 1 hr.</li>
        <li>Stir occasionally, particularly towards the end of the cooking time, so that the sauce doesn't catch on the
            bottom. If you like your sauce a little thinner add a splash of water.</li>
        <li>Serve half with pasta and chill or freeze the other half in 1-2 batches for later use.</li>
    </ol>
