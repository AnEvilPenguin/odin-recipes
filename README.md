### Project Synopsis

The project contains a simple landing page that contains a list of recipes.  Each recipe in the list has a link off to a sub-page with:

## Attribution

The recipes themselves have all come from BBC Good Food, which forms the basis of ~60% of my real world cooking (honorable mentions to Gordon Ramsay, Miss South (Slow Cooked), and Bosh for a good proportion of the rest of my cooking).
